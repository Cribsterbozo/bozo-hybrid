### About bozo HYBRID
Bozo HYBRID is the first NFTxTOKEN hybrid innovation changing the game.

Allowing a two-way liquidity portal by coupling the NFT market and token market into one.

This has created the first deflationary NFT to ever exist.

We have also solved the OTC escrow trust problem through this innovation, but better yet solved the whale slippage problem through the NFTxTOKEN hybrid model.

All inscripted and immutable on the blockchain forever.

We are building out Hybrid DeFi, or as some have put it, DeFi 2.0.
